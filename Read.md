Container: The outer div has a max width of screen-xl to center the content and make it responsive.
Images: Absolute positioning is used for background images, but their sizes are set to cover the full container.
Flexbox: Flexbox is used to arrange elements in columns and rows, making it easier to adjust the layout for different screen sizes.
Text and Boxes: Text elements are placed inside flex containers, and widths are set using Tailwind's responsive width utilities.
